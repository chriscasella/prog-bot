<h1>r/progmetal Prog-bot</h1>
<h4>This is a Reddit bot for the subreddit r/progmetal. As an avid lover of progressive metal, and all types of progressive music, I used this bot to solve an issue within the community. </h4>
<h4>Far too often do people ask for suggestions for similar bands on a song posting. This bot approaches that issue by monitoring the r/progmetal submission stream and scanning each post title</h4>
<h4>If it is in the format of 'Artist - Song' then it will perform and API calls to Last.fm and YouTube and respond with a comment of links to the top 3 similar artists to that post titled with the bands names</h4>
<h4>As a metal head/ musician/ programmer, I encourage you to spread the knowledge and love for music. Thanks for checking it out!</h4>
