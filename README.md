<h4 >This is a Reddit bot for the subreddit r/progmetal. As an avid lover of progressive metal, and all types of progressive music, I used this bot to solve an issue within the community. </h4>
<h4 >Far too often do people ask for suggestions for similar bands on a song posting. This bot approaches that issue by monitoring the r/progmetal submission stream and scanning each post title. If it is in the format of 'Artist - Song' then it will execute API calls to Last.fm and YouTube. <bold>prog-bot</bold> will respond with a comment of links to three similar artists youtube channel/videos</h4>
<h4 >As a metal head/ musician/ programmer, I encourage you to spread the knowledge and love for music. Thanks for checking it out!</h4>
